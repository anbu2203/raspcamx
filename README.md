**Pi-Non: The Pi Camera**      
This is a camera that can practically take amazing high quality photos and videos using just a raspberry pi!

**Hardware**    
This uses a Raspberry pi 4 8gb model and a sandisk luxe pendrive to make sure video recording is fast.      
It uses a Pi HQ Camera which has a sony IMX 477 12.3MP Sensor.      
It even has interchangeable lenses!    
I am powering the whole thing using a cuzor mini ups.

**Software**    
For software I am using the open source firmware called Cinemate2.    
It is built upon CinePi.
